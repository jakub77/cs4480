For simplicity your proxy should support version 1.0 of the HTTP
protocol, as defined in RFC 1945.

A significant simplification that comes from limiting the proxy
functionality to version 1.0 is that your proxy does not need to
support persistent connections. Recall that the default behavior
for HTTP 1.0 is non-persistent connections. Note, however, that
most browsers, including the latest version of Firefox automatically
add the optional "Connection: keep-alive" header line. Also, with
the latest version of Firefox it is no longer possible to disable
this behavior. I suggest you download an older version of Firefox
so that you can disable this. I tested with Firefox 15.0, although
other versions might also work. (See notes below.)

IMPORTANT: Note that older versions of browsers might have security
vulnerabilities. I therefor strongly suggest that if you get an
older version of Firefox to use for this programming assignment,
you do not use that for general web browsing, but only for the
assignment.

A further implication of using HTTP 1.0 is that you can infer that
you have received all the content from the server when the server
closes the connection. (See: http://www8.org/w8-papers/5c-protocols/key/key.html)

Also, as specified in the assignment the request forwarded to
the server should contain a  "Connection: close" header line 
to ensure that it closes the connection. (This might imply
replacing a "Connection: keep-alive" header if the client
had that in its request.)

Note about configuring Firefox:

Type 'about:config' in the title/search bar. You will be presented
with a very large number of parameter settings. You should set
the following parameters as shown:

network.http.proxy.version 1.0
network.http.version 1.0
network.http.keep-alive false
network.http.proxy.keep-alive false
network.http.pipelining false
network.http.proxy.pipelining false
